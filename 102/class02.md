This topic matters in that we should be learning the command line interface as good as we can.
This seems like an invaluable tool to be able to master sonyou can navigate around your computer.
It gives way more control than the regular guinthat we are used to, but does take some learning. 

There are apparently many text editors and ide's out there for us to use. I think the features i will be looking for will be 
syntax highlighting and code completion. I can see where there might become too many text editors and ide platforms on the market. 
Inwould equate this to hand tools. The less functions a particular tool has, usually the more worthy it is. i.e. when rachets gets fancy for NO reason.

A good tool is usually designed to do just one particular job, and the flashier it becomes, the less useful it usually becomes. iwnould go for trusted editors that 
call intonaction what developers actually need.
