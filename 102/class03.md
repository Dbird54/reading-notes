## Using Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows for many people to work on the same project at once, even remotely. It also allows for everyone to see who has done what work, to which file, when, and why!

Before this system was a central version control system, which did not provide very many fail-safes to protect againt data loss, and confusion amongst team members.

Prior to this, developers had to keep all of their files locally , and i could not imagine what kind of headache that would pose today. 

### What I Want To Learn More About

I want to become extremely proficient at git because it seems like such an invaluable tool to be able to get a lot of work done by a team. obviously you could do a lot of your own home business type of web sites without it, but even then it would help you tremendously just with its file orginization properties alone.

### My Concern

My concern with this is... Is it going to be around for a long time, or is there something else that is coming this way that willl take its place?
