## HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the languge that web browsers read to structure a web page. In other words, it is the building blocks of web pages. All of the information that will be seen by the user will be in HTML. 

This is obviously THE language used to build awesome websites. Even without CSS or JavaScript, HTML can build practical, functional websites by themselves. 

We are up to HTML5 now, which has brought even more functionality. 

## Things I Want To Know More About

I want to master HTML. This language in particular just amazes me. Being the foundation of most web pages, its importance to me is very significant. It seems like that if you master HTML, your CSS and JavaScript will be smoother as well. i.e... There might be something HTM can take care of which is less code and pages for the browser to go through.
