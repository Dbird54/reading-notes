## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language, used with HTML, that gives websites thier look. They are STYLE sheets, with information on them related to the stylings of HTML elements. 

Basically, you can take an element like the <p> tag (paragraph) and use CSS to give it style attributes like color, size, and placement. This can also be done inline with the HTML code, all in the head section of a page, or it can all live on a seperate file (CSS File) and linked to the HTML page in the head section. This helps webpages load faster since the code is being read seperately from the HTML while rendering pages. 

CSS is also a great way to minimize effort by being able to control all the elements on a whole site with just a few lines of code.
