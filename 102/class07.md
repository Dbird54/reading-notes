## Programming With JavaScript

Control flow is very important to understand when working with JavaScript. Code will be read from the first line until the lastline, unless there is a loop or conditin that states otherwise. Understanding this will save a lot of frusteration, as you should know in which order your code will run. If not, you will get unexpected errors.

Functions are like mini sub-programs within Javascript. They are a block of code created, and used over and over again if needed, that perform some sort of operation inside the block. They can sit there until called, or have inside of them that calls upon itself at certain times or when certain conditions are met.

Operators in JavaScript may be assigment operators, meaning the operator is assigning value to a variable. Or there could be arithmatic operators which perform math functions. There are other types of operators, but i am not there yet :)

## Things I Want To Know More About

I want to learn functions inside and out. I also want to learn how to nes them.
